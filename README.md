# Personal Projects
These projects showcase my independent work, primarily focused on market analysis and personal financial analytics. They reflect my exploration of data-driven strategies and insights in real-world scenarios:
- [Portfolio_MonteCarlo](https://github.com/marcosyuki/Portfolio_MonteCarlo) - Used Monte Carlo simulations to forecast stock portfolio performance, analyzed potential returns, and assessed worst drawdown periods based on historical stock data. Visualized simulation results and identified the worst drawdown in portfolio value. 
- [Portfolio_Optimization_Markowitz](https://github.com/marcosyuki/Portfolio_Optimization_Markowitz) - Optimized a stock portfolio by maximizing the Sharpe ratio, utilizing historical price data to simulate various portfolios and identify the best combination of stocks. 
- [Stock_Beta_CostOfEquity](https://github.com/marcosyuki/Stock_Beta_CostOfEquity) - Conducted a comprehensive analysis of a stock's performance relative to the S&P 500, calculating Beta, R-squared, and Cost of Equity using the CAPM model. 
- [BRA_MacroEconomy](https://github.com/marcosyuki/MacroEconomy) - Developed a Python script to extract, analyze, and visualize trends in the Brazilian Treasury Bond (SELIC) and Inflation (IPCA) rates using data from the Central Bank of Brazil's API.
- [Stock_Drawdown_Analysis](https://github.com/marcosyuki/Stock_Drawdown_Analysis) - Analyzed the historical drawdown of a stock to identify the worst decline in price over a specified period, including its duration and the start and end dates.
- [Market_Report_PDF_Generation](https://github.com/marcosyuki/Market_Report_PDF_Generation) - Created an automated process to generate daily market reports in PDF format, including real-time financial data for key indices and currency pairs. 
- [PDF_Extraction_Analysis](https://github.com/marcosyuki/PDF_Extraction_Analysis) - Extracted and analyzed text from a PDF document, generated a word cloud for visualizing word frequencies, and performed sentiment analysis to assess the overall tone of the text. 
- [DataScraper_Selenium](https://github.com/marcosyuki/DataScraper_Selenium) - Developed a web scraper to collect job listings and analyze job requirements. Utilized Selenium for web automation, pandas for data management, and NLTK for text analysis to extract and process job data from Indeed.
- [TennisDB_Scraping_BeautifulSoap](https://github.com/marcosyuki/TennisDB_Scraping_BeautifulSoap-) - Scraped and analyzed data on tennis racquets from multiple manufacturers, organizing it into a structured format and exporting it to an Excel file for further analysis. 
- [Establishment_Finder_Distance_MapVisualization](https://github.com/marcosyuki/Establishment_Finder_Distance_MapVisualization) - Developed an application to identify and rank nearby establishments based on proximity, utilizing Google Maps API for location data and Folium for visualizing results on an interactive map.
